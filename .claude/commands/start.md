description: Start the frontend development server locally
---

Start the frontend development server:

1. Navigate to the frontend directory
2. Run: `npm run dev`
3. Report the server URL (usually http://localhost:5173)
4. Note that the server will run in the foreground with hot reload enabled

If port 5173 is already in use, inform the user and ask if they want to kill the existing process.
