Build the frontend application for production:

1. Navigate to the frontend directory
2. Run: `npm run build`
3. Report the build output and any errors
4. Show the dist directory size and contents
5. Optionally preview the build using: `npm run preview`

The production build will be output to the `dist/` directory.
